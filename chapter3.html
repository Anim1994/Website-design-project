			<p>He starts off his journey to overcome the first obstacle Zeus has provided him. He is now in the Brexelian forest where the sentient beast Onisha sleeps. 
				<br>It's said Onisha is as old as the Earth and has seen everything.
				<br> Onisha is a kind gentle beast who has been grievened by the continuous malicious actions of humans that harm the environment.On his way to the forest Anim stumbles upon a majestic bird. He marvels at its sight and gets more determined to save the environment. He keeps moving forward to the centre of the forest to find Onisha.

			<p> The forest keeps on surprising and mesmerising Anim with its beauty. Somewhere deep in his heart, he was happy that the world is in crisis. For if it not for that he would never have ventured forth on this journey and found such prestine places that are a feast to the eyes. While he was sitting and having some fruits that he plucked off a tree, he watches a couple of Zebras that seem to be very much in love. He wonders what his future family would be like. As soon as he is done eating, he keeps moving on to find Onisha. It seems in the heart of the forest lies an island where Onisha resides, Anim fortunately and surprisingly finds a boat and starts rowing to the centre.

			 <p><br> He gets off the boat and takes his first step on the island. Time was of the essence, but the island was huge. Where could Onisha be residing?. Few minutes later he notices a fox is looking at him. He asks the fox 'Can you take me to Onisha?'. The fox nods and starts running. Anim wastes no time and tries to keep up with the cunning animal.

			 <figcaption> Onisha, the one who has seen it all.</figcaption>
				<p> Out of the blue there it was, standing. It was an elephant but no mere elephant, it was the spirit of the forest in to physical manifestation. The beast who has seen it all, <strong>Onisha </strong>.
				<br>
				<br>
				Anim pleads to Onisha to forgive the humans. Onisha who is a gentle soul asks Anim 'Why should I forgive the humans for all they do is damage the eco-system and engage in deforestation?.' <br>
				Anim had no answer to this question but asks the beast to be kind and give the humans another chance. Onisha had sharp eyes, it notices the belt Anim is wearing and asks him "how did you get to be in the possession of that belt boy?, you look familiar". Anim replies that it was given to him by his father.
				<br>
				<br>
				Onisha then laughs and tells Anim "Luck seems to be on your side for you are the son of Malcom. Are you not?. I owe Malcom for once he saved me but I'll not get in to the details of the encounter. Very well, I forgive thee humans. Move along now, I need to eat."
				<br>
				<br>
				 "Thank you so much Lord Onisha for trusting us again, I never could have believed in my wildest dreams that my father would have an encounter with you and that this belt would be the saviour of humans. May I take a branch from one of the oak trees here with your permission?". Onisha nods, Anims pick a small branch, puts it in his backpack safely and moves to his last mission.
