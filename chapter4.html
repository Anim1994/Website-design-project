			 <figcaption> "The village of Night Gloom</figcaption>
			<p>For the last trial Anim travelled to the village of Night Gloom. This time the person he had to meet and persuade was the king of all Skallors. Skallor is a tribe of nomads who live in ancient ways and have a special connection with the nature.
				<br> After getting inside the village Anim was bamboozled. From the outside it looked like the village was very small and lived like the oldest of the homosapiens. He was wrong, the village actually was quite big and had some modern touches. 
				<br>He took some rest in an inn in the village. The villagers were very warm and nice to Anim, who, was an outsider.
				<br> The following morning, he rushed out of his bed and went to have an attendance with their king. It is as though the king was expecting Anim. The guards welcomed Anim and the King himself was waiting for him.
				<br> Anim was astonished at the amazing gesture of the Skallor people and the fact that the king himself was waiting for Anim was even more unbelievable. He bowed before the king and said 
				<br> "my lord, I am humbled to be in your presence. I come under the most dire circumstances. If you do not forgive the outside world then the whole human race shall be eradicated. Surely the mighty king shall not let all the innocents suffer just because of the actions of few."

			<p> The king laughs and says 'Oh dear child, you are modest yet gullible. Surely you do not believe that I can truly forgive the humans?. This village used to have more happy people, we are now just an empty shell of our former glory. The outsiders are cruel. They cut our trees, our animals die, our people get taken from us to work as slaves for them'
			<br> Anim's determination was strong, he knew there was no going back after coming so close.
			<br> He asks the king <br>
			"If all the humans die, won't you die as well?"
			<br> "No!, we are shielded by the Gods. There shall be reckoning and a new beginning", the King replies.
			<br> 'Is there really no way to persuade you? I have managed to entice the god of the oceans Poseidon himself, took an oak tree branch from the mighty Onisha. Surely if they can find a way to forgive the humans, you can too?', Anim says.
			<br> "Come here lad, you seem to be very optimistic and kind. Maybe not everyone is same, maybe there could be more people like you. Okay then, what should I do so that your bargain with Zeus is complete?" - the king.
			<br> "Thank you so much Oh mighty king, all I need is your golden cup. I promise to return here in the future and help your people".

			 <figcaption> Anim sees a child taking care of plants.</figcaption>
			 <p><br> Anim gets out of the house. As he is walking towards the outskirts of the village he notices a child taking care of some plants. He feels so grateful and happy that he was able to have such a wonderful experience. He watches the famous waterfall in this area as well. He keeps walking towards his final step.
			 	<br> With that, Anim successfully accomplished all the goals Zeus had given him. It was time to summon the God of Thunder Himself with all the items gathered.
